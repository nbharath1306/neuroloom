## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Currently, the app doesn't require any environment variables. All RSS feeds are public.

If you want to add rate limiting or analytics later, create `.env.production`:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## 📱 Custom Domain Setup

### On Vercel:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS records as shown

### Example DNS Records:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.19

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Before Deployment

### 1. Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Test all filters
- Test search functionality
- Test on mobile (Chrome DevTools)
- Click through multiple articles

### 2. Build Test
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
- Ensure production build works
- Check for any errors

### 3. Lighthouse Score
- Open Chrome DevTools
- Run Lighthouse audit
- Aim for 90+ on all metrics

---

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations (Already Implemented)

- ✅ Next.js 14 with App Router (fastest framework)
- ✅ Server-side RSS fetching (better for SEO)
- ✅ Parallel feed fetching (Promise.all)
- ✅ Optimized images and icons
- ✅ Tailwind CSS (minimal CSS bundle)
- ✅ No external dependencies for UI

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Some RSS feeds fail
**Solution**: Feeds are fetched in parallel. If one fails, others still work. Currently:
- ✅ TechCrunch - Working
- ✅ AI News - Working
- ✅ Economic Times - Working
- ✅ Indian Express - Working
- ✅ The Verge - Working
- ⚠️ MIT feed - Sometimes slow
- ⚠️ Wired AI - Backup for Reuters

### Issue: Slow initial load
**Solution**: First load compiles the page. Subsequent loads are instant. This is normal in development. In production (Vercel), it's pre-rendered.

---

## 📊 Analytics (Optional)

### Add Google Analytics:
1. Get your GA4 tracking ID
2. Add to `app/layout.tsx`:
```tsx
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
  __html: `
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
  `
}} />
```

---

## 🔒 Security

### Current Security Features:
- ✅ All links open in new tab (`target="_blank"`)
- ✅ `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links
- ✅ No user data collection
- ✅ No authentication required
- ✅ HTTPS by default on Vercel

---

## 🎨 Customization After Deployment

### Change Colors:
Edit `tailwind.config.js` and `app/globals.css`

### Add More Sources:
Edit `app/api/news/route.ts` - add new RSS feeds to the array

### Change Update Frequency:
RSS feeds are fetched on each page load. To add caching:
- Implement Redis cache
- Or use Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check Feed Health:
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/news
```

### Monitor Logs (Vercel):
- Go to your project dashboard
- Click "Logs" tab
- See real-time feed fetch status

---
