## 🚀 Where Your Profile Appears

Your profile section is positioned **between** the hero section and the news feed. 

It will show:
1. Hero with NeuroLoom title
2. ⭐ **YOUR PROFILE** ⭐ (NEW!)
3. Latest Feed section
4. Footer

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Best Image**: Square, 800x800px minimum, good lighting
2. **Social Handles**: Use @ format for consistency
3. **Bio**: Keep it concise but personal (2-3 sentences)
4. **Stats**: Be creative! Use emojis that match your vibe
5. **Test Mobile**: Looks amazing on phones too!

## 🎭 Color Scheme Already Matches!

Your profile uses the same dopamine color system:
- 💙 Blue (`--accent-primary`)
- 💜 Purple (`--accent-secondary`)
- 💚 Green (`--accent-success`)
- 🧡 Orange (`--accent-warning`)
- 💗 Pink (`--accent-pink`)
- 💎 Cyan (`--accent-info`)

Everything is already perfectly integrated with your theme switcher!

## ⚠️ Don't Forget!

After making changes, check:
1. Save all files (Cmd/Ctrl + S)
2. Dev server should auto-reload
3. Hard refresh if needed (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)
